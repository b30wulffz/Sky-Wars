## Gameplay

- Upon launching the website, the game starts.
- The space plane starts flying in the forward direction across the galaxy.
- The directional movement of the plane can be performed using the below mentioned keys. Note that this directional movement is limited to a particular limit in order to make the game more challenging.
- The plane needs to avoid asteroids as they cause a minor damage.
- Similarly, the plane needs to avoid enemy planes, else it will crash. These enemy planes also shoot powerballs which should be avoided as well because they can deal huge damage to the plane.
- In order to destroy asteroids and enemy planes, shoot powerballs at them.
- At a time, one can shoot a maximum of 3 powerballs, which will get refilled after sometime.
- The plane needs to collect stars which give a pretty good push to the score.
- The game will end once the plane's health reduces to zero, and thus, it will crash.
- In order to restart the game, webpage should be reloaded.
